                <p>These instructions serve as a guide for contributing to the MoilApp repository with a
                  personal repository project. The process includes forking the MoilApp repository,
                  modifying the project code, and submitting a pull request to merge the changes.
                  It is essential to keep in mind that the guidelines and instructions may differ depending on MoilApp
                  specific requirements and guidelines.</p>

                      title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
                  <p>The Contribution Workflow outlines the process by which contributions are submitted, reviewed, and
                    integrated into the project. Below is a detailed guide to our contribution workflow:</p>
                  <ol class="arabic simple">
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Select a Contribution</strong>: The first step in the contribution workflow is to
                        select a contribution you would like to make. This could be fixing a bug, implementing a new
                        feature, improving documentation, or any other enhancement that aligns with the project’s goals.
                      </p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Fork the Repository</strong>: Once you’ve identified the contribution you’d like to
                        make, fork the project’s repository on GitHub. This creates a copy of the repository under your
                        GitHub account where you can make changes without affecting the original project.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Create a Branch</strong>: Before making any changes, create a new branch in your forked
                        repository to work on your contribution. Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects
                        the nature of your contribution.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Make Changes</strong>: With your branch created, make the necessary changes to the
                        codebase to address the contribution you’ve selected. Ensure that your changes adhere to the
                        project’s coding standards and guidelines.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Commit Changes</strong>: Once you’ve completed your changes, commit them to your branch
                        with descriptive commit messages. Each commit should represent a single logical change and
                        include a brief explanation of the changes made.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Push Changes</strong>: After committing your changes, push your branch to your forked
                        repository on GitHub. This makes your changes available for review by the project maintainers.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Submit a Pull Request (PR)</strong>: Once your changes are pushed to your forked
                        repository, submit a pull request (PR) to the original project’s repository. In your PR, provide
                        a detailed description of the changes you’ve made, including any relevant context or reasoning.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Review Process</strong>: After submitting your PR, the project maintainers will review
                        your changes. They may provide feedback, ask questions, or request additional changes. Be
                        responsive to feedback and be prepared to make further revisions to your contribution if
                        necessary.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Address Feedback</strong>: If feedback is provided on your PR, address it by making the
                        requested changes to your branch and committing them. Once you’ve addressed all feedback, push
                        your changes to your forked repository and update your PR.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Merge PR</strong>: Once your PR has been approved by the project maintainers and all
                        feedback has been addressed, it will be merged into the original project’s repository.
                        Congratulations, your contribution has been successfully integrated into the project!</p>

                    <p>Once you have finished cloning the repository, you can open the project folder using PyCharm and
                      create a virtual environment configuration by pressing <strong>Ctrl + Alt + S</strong>. This step
                      is necessary before installing the required library. It is important to carefully follow each step
                      in order to create a local environment for your project, ensuring that the application runs
                      properly as required.</p>

                    <p>Setting the virtual environment and installation requirements</p>
                    <p>By adhering to these instructions, you can guarantee that the application operates as planned and
                      that there are no inconsistencies between its requirements and other projects’ dependencies on
                      your system. Establishing a virtual environment for each project is a recommended approach that
                      can assist you in more efficiently managing dependencies and ensuring that your projects are kept
                      separate from one another.</p>

                  <p>Guidelines for Pull Requests (PRs) help ensure that contributions to our project are effectively
                    reviewed and integrated. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to create PRs following our guidelines:
                  </p>
                  <ol class="arabic simple">
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Understand the Contribution</strong>: Before creating a PR, ensure that you understand
                        the contribution you’re making. Whether it’s fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, or
                        updating documentation, familiarize yourself with the changes you intend to propose.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Create a Descriptive Title</strong>: When creating a PR, use a clear and descriptive
                        title that summarizes the purpose of the contribution. A well-written title helps reviewers
                        quickly understand the nature of the changes being proposed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Provide Context</strong>: In the PR description, provide context about the problem
                        being addressed or the feature being implemented. Explain the rationale behind the changes and
                        any relevant background information that will help reviewers understand the purpose of the PR.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Link Related Issues</strong>: If the PR addresses a specific issue or is related to an
                        existing discussion or feature request, be sure to link to the relevant issue(s) in the PR
                        description. This helps provide additional context and ensures that the PR is associated with
                        the appropriate discussion or tracking.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Follow Coding Standards</strong>: Ensure that your code adheres to the project’s coding
                        standards and style guidelines. Consistent formatting and adherence to best practices make it
                        easier for reviewers to understand and evaluate your changes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Test Your Changes</strong>: Before creating a PR, thoroughly test your changes to
                        ensure that they work as intended and don’t introduce any regressions or unintended side
                        effects. Include any necessary test cases or documentation updates to accompany your changes.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Keep PRs Small and Focused</strong>: Whenever possible, keep PRs small and focused on
                        addressing a single issue or implementing a specific feature. Smaller PRs are easier to review
                        and less likely to introduce conflicts with other changes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Be Responsive to Feedback</strong>: After creating a PR, be responsive to feedback from
                        reviewers. Address any comments or suggestions promptly and be open to making further revisions
                        as needed to ensure the quality and completeness of your contribution.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Update PR as Necessary</strong>: If additional changes or revisions are requested by
                        reviewers, update the PR accordingly. Push new commits to your branch and ensure that your PR
                        remains up-to-date with the latest changes in the project.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Celebrate Success</strong>: Once your PR has been reviewed and approved, celebrate your
                        contribution to the project! Your efforts help improve the project for everyone, and your
                        contributions are greatly appreciated.</p>

                  <p>Once you’ve submitted a pull request, it will undergo a code review process. The code review
                    process plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality and consistency of our project’s codebase.
                    It involves a comprehensive examination of proposed changes, where reviewers meticulously analyze
                    aspects such as functionality, readability, performance, and adherence to coding standards. Feedback
                    provided during the review is constructive and specific, aimed at helping contributors enhance their
                    code. This iterative process of collaboration between reviewers and contributors ensures that code
                    changes undergo multiple rounds of refinement until they meet the project’s standards and
