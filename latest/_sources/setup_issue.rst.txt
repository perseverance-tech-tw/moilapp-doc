Reporting bugs and issues is crucial for maintaining the quality and reliability of our project. here's how to effectively report bugs and issues on our GitHub repository:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before reporting a new bug or issue, check the project's issue tracker on GitHub to see if the problem has already been reported. If you find an existing issue that matches your problem, you can add additional information or provide feedback to help resolve it.
2. **Create a New Issue**: If you're unable to find an existing issue that matches your problem, create a new issue by clicking on the "New issue" button in the project's issue tracker. Provide a descriptive title that summarizes the issue and a detailed description that includes the following information:

    - Steps to reproduce the issue: Provide a clear and concise set of steps that demonstrate how to reproduce the problem.
    - Expected behavior: Describe what you expected to happen when following the steps.
    - Actual behavior: Describe what actually happened when following the steps, including any error messages or unexpected outcomes.
