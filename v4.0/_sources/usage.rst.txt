.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    - After selecting the file to open, a combo box prompt will appear asking you to select the type of camera that
    was used. The camera parameters can be loaded from the database using this.</p>

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    - There are two ways to open the camera: through USB or via streaming. You can use the combo box to pick the USB port
    that is being used for a camera, click "OK," and you will be prompted to select the type of camera that is being used.
    As depicted in the picture below.</p>

    We offer controls for video and camera media, including play, pause, stop, forward, backward, and a slider timer.
    Where image processing can be facilitated by the use of this controller.</p>

12. Anypoint View
------------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    Sometimes we only want to look at places where there is a lot of information in order to improve the outcomes of observations.
    As a result, we can apply the approach of the undistortion rectilinear selected image. This approach shifts the
    optical axis to the specified <b>zenithal (alpha)</b> and <b>azimuthal (beta)</b> angles, then converts the image plane coordinate
    to hemispherical coordinates.

    Anypoint view has two modes, with mode 1 being the result of alphaOffset degree rotation followed by betaOffset degree
    rotation around the Z-axis (roll) (pitch). In contrast, mode-2 produces a thetaY degree rotation around the Y axis (yaw)
    following a thetaX degree rotation around the X axis (pitch).</p>

Mouse Event
===========

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    There are several functions of the mouse event that you can use to speed up work. The mouse event will only work on
    the result image and the original image of the user interface widget. Some of the mouse event's functions include.</p>

Mouse click event
-----------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    When in Anypoint mode, the mouse click event only functions on the original picture widget. The coordinates of
    the points whose alpha-beta value will be transformed can be easily determined using this. which means that when
    converting the original image to an Anypoint image, this value will be a parameter.</p>

Mouse press-move event
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    The mouse press event has its own function in each image widget; in the origin image, this widget works in Anypoint mode.
    Which allows for surrounding views. If you press the press-move mouse event on the result image widget,
    different functions are available. You can enlarge the area you are interested in using this function, and it works
    in all-mode view, as in the example shown in the image below:</p>

Double click event
------------------

The Double click mouse event has function to reset Anypoint view to default in Anypoint mode.

Right click event
-----------------

If you right click on the mouse, it will display menu options like maximized, minimized, save image and show info.

Mouse wheel
-----------

Wheel event will work by pressing the ctrl key simultaneously to zoom in and zoom out images on the user interface display
