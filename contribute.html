<h2>Contribution Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#contribution-workflow" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The Contribution Workflow outlines the process by which contributions are submitted, reviewed, and integrated into the project. Below is a detailed guide to our contribution workflow:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Select a Contribution</strong>: The first step in the contribution workflow is to select a contribution you would like to make. This could be fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, improving documentation, or any other enhancement that aligns with the project’s goals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fork the Repository</strong>: Once you’ve identified the contribution you’d like to make, fork the project’s repository on GitHub. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account where you can make changes without affecting the original project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create a Branch</strong>: Before making any changes, create a new branch in your forked repository to work on your contribution. Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the nature of your contribution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make Changes</strong>: With your branch created, make the necessary changes to the codebase to address the contribution you’ve selected. Ensure that your changes adhere to the project’s coding standards and guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commit Changes</strong>: Once you’ve completed your changes, commit them to your branch with descriptive commit messages. Each commit should represent a single logical change and include a brief explanation of the changes made.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Push Changes</strong>: After committing your changes, push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub. This makes your changes available for review by the project maintainers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Submit a Pull Request (PR)</strong>: Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository, submit a pull request (PR) to the original project’s repository. In your PR, provide a detailed description of the changes you’ve made, including any relevant context or reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Process</strong>: After submitting your PR, the project maintainers will review your changes. They may provide feedback, ask questions, or request additional changes. Be responsive to feedback and be prepared to make further revisions to your contribution if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Address Feedback</strong>: If feedback is provided on your PR, address it by making the requested changes to your branch and committing them. Once you’ve addressed all feedback, push your changes to your forked repository and update your PR.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merge PR</strong>: Once your PR has been approved by the project maintainers and all feedback has been addressed, it will be merged into the original project’s repository. Congratulations, your contribution has been successfully integrated into the project!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Provide Context</strong>: In the PR description, provide context about the problem being addressed or the feature being implemented. Explain the rationale behind the changes and any relevant background information that will help reviewers understand the purpose of the PR.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Link Related Issues</strong>: If the PR addresses a specific issue or is related to an existing discussion or feature request, be sure to link to the relevant issue(s) in the PR description. This helps provide additional context and ensures that the PR is associated with the appropriate discussion or tracking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Follow Coding Standards</strong>: Ensure that your code adheres to the project’s coding standards and style guidelines. Consistent formatting and adherence to best practices make it easier for reviewers to understand and evaluate your changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Test Your Changes</strong>: Before creating a PR, thoroughly test your changes to ensure that they work as intended and don’t introduce any regressions or unintended side effects. Include any necessary test cases or documentation updates to accompany your changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep PRs Small and Focused</strong>: Whenever possible, keep PRs small and focused on addressing a single issue or implementing a specific feature. Smaller PRs are easier to review and less likely to introduce conflicts with other changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be Responsive to Feedback</strong>: After creating a PR, be responsive to feedback from reviewers. Address any comments or suggestions promptly and be open to making further revisions as needed to ensure the quality and completeness of your contribution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update PR as Necessary</strong>: If additional changes or revisions are requested by reviewers, update the PR accordingly. Push new commits to your branch and ensure that your PR remains up-to-date with the latest changes in the project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Celebrate Success</strong>: Once your PR has been reviewed and approved, celebrate your contribution to the project! Your efforts help improve the project for everyone, and your contributions are greatly appreciated.</p></li>
