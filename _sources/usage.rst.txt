   <p style="text-align: justify;">

   "MoilApp software application" when it is running for the first time, specifically, the application will display a <b><i>splash</i></b> screen to the user, which is a graphical image or animation that indicates that the application is loading and that will be available soon. This splash screen is a new feature that has been added to the latest version of MoilApp (version 4.1). </p>

   Select Media Source

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    - After selecting the file to open, a combo box prompt will appear asking you to select the type of camera that
    was used. The camera parameters can be loaded from the database using this.</p>

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    - There are two ways to open the camera: through USB or via streaming. You can use the combo box to pick the USB port
    that is being used for a camera, click <b>OK</b>. And then, you will be prompted to select the type of camera that is being used.
    As depicted in the picture below.</p>

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    - The streaming camera option allows you to access the camera_url using the stream server URL. You merely need
    to enter the camera's URL and click <b><i>"OK"</i></b> button, as seen below. In the combo box prompt,
    you will be prompted to select the type of camera being utilized.</p>

2. Recent Open
----------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    The Recent Open feature enhances user experience by providing quick and convenient access to previously used files.
    This feature maintains a list of recently opened images or projects, allowing users to reopen their recent work
    without navigating through the entire file system.</p>

    After selecting a file from the recent list, you can choose from two options:</p>

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    - Saved Configuration: This feature allows you to access the history of media files you have recently opened.</p>

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    - Directory: This feature lets you access the directory to load media files directly.</p>

3. Rotate Image
----------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    MoilApp has two rotate functions: rotate the left image and rotate the right image. Rotation can be operated
    by entering a value on the rotate scale, this helps the user to rotate with a lesser scale.</p>

.. figure:: assets/usage/4.Rotate-Image.png
   :scale: 40 %
   :alt: Processing to Rotate Right and Left Image
   :align: center

4. Zoom Image
-------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    The user can zoom in and out using the <i>plus</i> and <i>minus</i> buttons, respectively, in this program. In addition,
    the user can select the zoom scale to be smaller by a minimum of <i>25 degrees</i> and above to make the final image.</p>

.. figure:: assets/usage/5.Zoom-Image.png

5. Default Application
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    The application will automatically return to the original image when the default button is clicked.
    When the user is processing an image, for instance, when the user is processing an image to any point and then
    decides they want to go back to the original image, this position is the position when the user loaded the image
    when opening the application.</p>

14. Anypoint View
------------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    Sometimes we only want to look at places where there is a lot of information in order to improve the outcomes of observations.
    As a result, we can apply the approach of  undistortion rectilinear selected image. This approach shifts the
    optical axis to the specified <b>zenithal (alpha)</b> and <b>azimuthal (beta)</b> angles, then converts the image plane coordinate
    to hemispherical coordinates.

    Anypoint view has two modes, with mode 1 being the result of alphaOffset degree rotation followed by betaOffset degree
    rotation around the Z-axis (roll) (pitch). In contrast, mode-2 produces a thetaY degree rotation around the Y axis (yaw)
    following a thetaX degree rotation around the X axis (pitch).</p>

.. figure:: assets/usage/14.anypoint-image.jpg
   :scale: 20%
   :alt: Anypoint Image
   :align: center

   Processing Anypoint Image

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    You can switch from <b>mode 1 to mode 2</b> or vice versa by pressing the help button when in Anypoint view mode.
    The help button can also be used to view Anypoint results coming from a certain angle. An overview of the additional
    button in Anypoint view mode may be found below.</p>

15. Panorama view
------------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    As explained earlier, the panorama view may present a horizontal view in a specific immersed environment to meet
     human visual perception. The figure below shows a diagram of transforming a fisheye image into a panoramic view.</p>

.. figure:: assets/diagram.jpg

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    - The maximum and minimum FoV values can also be changed using the lineedit feature, which is only available in this mode.</p>

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    - By clicking the save image button or selecting save image from the context menu when you right-click on the
      result image, you can save the original image or the result image. When you save an image for the first time,
      the application will open a dialog box asking you to select the directory you want to utilize as storage.</p>

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    - Use the record button to start recording a video, it works almost just like storing an image.You will be asked
      to select a directory before you can begin recording, and the video files will be saved there.</p>

16. Camera parameters
---------------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    The camera parameter is a very important component in fisheye image processing. Each fisheye camera can be calibrated.
    and derive a set of parameters by the <b>MOIL laboratory</b> before the successive functions can work correctly,
    configuration is necessary at the beginning of the program. MoilApp provides a form dialog that can add, modify,
    and delete parameters that will be stored in the database. To be able to use this feature,
    please click on File–>Camera Parameters.  The overview of this form is shown in the picture below: </p>

   Application Settings

Mouse Event
===========

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    There are several functions of the mouse event that you can use to speed up work. The mouse event will only work on
    the result image and the original image of the user interface widget. Some of the mouse event functions are included. </p>

Mouse click event
-----------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    When in Anypoint mode, the mouse click event only functions on the original picture widget. The coordinates of
    the points whose alpha-beta value will be transformed can be easily determined using this. which means that when
    converting the original image to an Anypoint image, this value will be a parameter.</p>

Mouse click-move event
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">

    The mouse-click event has its own function in each image widget; in the original image, this widget works in Anypoint mode, which allows for surrounding views. If you press the press-move mouse event on the resultant image widget, different functions are available. You can enlarge the area in which you are interested using this function, and it works in all-mode view, as in the example shown in the image below.</p>
Double click event
------------------

The Double click mouse event has function to reset Anypoint view to default in Anypoint mode.

Right click event
-----------------

If you right click on the mouse, it will display menu options like maximize, minimize, save image and show info.

Mouse wheel
-----------
**Wheel event** will work by pressing the ctrl key simultaneously to zoom in and zoom out images on the user interface display.

Keyboard Shortcut
=====================

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align: justify;">
