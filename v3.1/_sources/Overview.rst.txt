    <p>
        MoilApp is an image processing program created by <b> MOIL-LAB</b>, a laboratory specialising in omnidirectional imaging and surveillance. The program utilises the <b>Moildev SDK</b>, a technique for processing Fisheye Images. This SDK is most commonly used for creating <b>Panorama Views</b> and <b>Anypoint View</b>, as it enables the processing of Fisheye Images, which are known for their high image quality and wide-angle FoV (Field of View). This feature makes it ideal for various applications, such as surveillance systems, computer vision, etc.

    Fisheye camera technology is widely used in various industries, such as 3D measurement, medicine, ADAS(Advanced driver-assistance systems), and many more.
    With their ability to capture a wide-angle field of view, fisheye cameras provide high-quality images and data that are essential in various applications.
    The technology has become increasingly prevalent, offering a cost-effective solution for capturing large areas without the need for multiple cameras.
    In 3D measurement, fisheye cameras capture data with high accuracy, while in medicine they are used for endoscopy procedures.
    In ADAS systems, fisheye cameras provide a 360-degree view of the vehicle, enhancing safety and driver assistance features.
    With the increasing demand for high-quality imaging and data in various industries, the use of fisheye camera technology is expected to continue to grow in the future.
